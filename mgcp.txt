The origin of digit map or dialplan
-----------------------------------
The origin of digit map is in MGCP.

This digit map is expressed using a syntax derived from the Unix system
command, egrep.  For example, the dial plan described above results
in the following digit map:

(0T|00T|[1-7]xxx|8xxxxxxx|#xxxxxxx|*xx|91xxxxxxxxxx|9011x.T)

The formal syntax of the digit map is described by the DigitMap rule
in the formal syntax description of the protocol (see Appendix A) -


What is an MGCP package
----------------------------
This is achieved by the concept of packages, which are
simply well-defined groupings of extensions.
