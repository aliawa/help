Simple, easy, and efficient way to initialize structs 
------------------------------------------------------

Struct instances created on the stack are uninitialized (i.e., contain garbage values). The easiest, most efficient, and future-proof way to initialize them is: 
struct  PlainData {
char [20] name;
long ID;
char [15] phone;
//... other fields as many as you like 
};

int main()
{
	PlainData data = {0};  //automatic initialization of the rest 					//of data to binary zeroes is 						//guaranteed both for C and C++
}

This is a much better way than manually assigning values to all the fields of the struct (which may also turn into a maintenance nightmare when new struct members are added or deleted) and it is at least as efficient as a 
 memset()
call—usually much more efficient.
