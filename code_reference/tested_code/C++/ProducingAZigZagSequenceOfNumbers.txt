We need a number sequence appropriate for filling a two column table.
Example

5 Elements in A();

1 A(0)		4 A(3)
2 A(1)		5 A(4)
3 A(2)

Sequence: 0,3,1,4,2


4 Elements in A();

1 A(0)		3 A(2)
2 A(1)		4 A(3)

Sequence: 0,2,1,3

I use two variables, one representing the line number(x) the other is the index number. Normally a variable should be needed for column nr. and a loop to increment it. This has been avoided. Row is incremented in the second column. This is a problem for even numbered items because x is incremented before the test (x<nLinesCount) and the last items is not reached. This is solved by the second condition if (x*2) < no. of items we can still continue.

NOTE: I think this code would be much easier if row and column variables been used
e.g., i= nRow + nCol * nLineCount. Simple

size_t nCount = blChannelSegmentInfoList.entries();
size_t nLinesCount = (nCount>>1)+(nCount&1L);
TABLE_START(IDsAllChannelSegments, nLinesCount );
	
size_t i=0, x=0;
while( x<nLinesCount || (x>0 && 2*x++ == nCount) )
{
	// Port
	tstr0.Format("%d", i+1);
	(pTable->TableFields).Add(tstr0);

	// SIID
	TABLE_FIELD_NUM(blChannelSegmentInfoList[i]->CHANNEL_SIID);

	i = (i<nLinesCount)? nLinesCount+x++ : x;

}
