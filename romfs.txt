    -v          : output actions performed.
    -e env-var  : only take action if env-var is set to "y".
    -o option   : only take action if option is set to "y".
    -p perms    : chmod style permissions for dst.
    -d          : make dst directory if it doesn't exist
    -S          : don't strip after installing
    -a text     : append text to dst.
    -A pattern  : only append text if pattern doesn't exist in file
    -l link     : dst is a link to 'link'.
    -s sym-link : dst is a sym-link to 'sym-link'.

    if "src" is not provided,  basename is run on dst to determine the
    source in the current directory.

    multiple -e and -o options are ANDed together.  To achieve an OR affect
    use a single -e/-o with 1 or more y/n/"" chars in the condition.

    if src is a directory,  everything in it is copied recursively to dst
    with special files removed (currently CVS and Subversion dirs).
