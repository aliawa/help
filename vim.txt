#include "f CTRL−x CTRL−f"
:set dictionary=file
Ctrl-x Ctrl-k : complete from dictionary
[[ go to start of function

Executing commands (v and g)
-----------------------------
:[range]g/{pattern}/[cmd]
             Execute Ex command [cmd] (default: ":p") on the lines
                within [range] where {pattern} matches.
:[range]g!/{pattern}/[cmd]     or    :[range]v/{pattern}/[cmd]

switch esc and caps lock
------------------------
- create .Xmodmap
  keycode 9=Caps_Lock
  keycode 66=Escape
  


marks
---------
  mx   tells Vim to add a mark called x.
  `x tells Vim to return to the line and column for mark x.
  'x tells Vim to return to the beginning of the line where mark x is set.
  `. moves the cursor to the line and column where the last edit was made.
  '. moves the cursor to the line where the last edit was made.
  '" moves the cursor to the last position of the cursor when you exited the
     previous session.
  :marks shows all marks set.
  :marks x shows the mark named x.
  :jumps shows the jumplist.
  Ctrl-o moves the cursor to the last jump.
  Ctrl-i moves the cursor to the previous jump.


  Examples:
  -----------
  :'g,'k d   
    delete lines between mark g and k
  
  :'s,. w ~/tmp/file.txt 
    write text between mark s and current cursor position to ~/tmp/file.txt


visual selection
----------------
v       selection mode
V       select by line
Ctrl V  block select
gv      select previous visual area


show hidden symbols
-------------------
:set list
:set nolist



Folds
----------------------
:set foldmethod=indent
' then use zm and zr

zo -- open one fold level under cursor 
zc -- close one fold level under cursor

zr -- reduce folding by one level (open one more level)
zm -- fold more by one level

zR -- open all folds  (R for Reduce)
zM -- close all folds 


:set foldmethod=marker
' then enter /* some text {{{ */ at the begining
' enter /* }}}*/ at the end
' go in the block and zm

:set foldmethod=manual
' then go inside a {} block zfa}
' visual select and zf


Visible screen actions
----------------------
dL - Delete to end of page, in other words, everything visible.


tricks
------
daw     : delete whole word
imap <M-f> <E
visual mode selection followed by !sort is really useful for sorting lines
C - Often overlooked: chop off end of line and go into insert mode.
c/"[enter] Great for modifying things in quotes:
Much easier is to use :a! (or :i!), paste your text and then end the paste 
    with a line containing just .
:sp to split the screen er ctrl-w-w
gF: Open the file under the cursor,

(ctrl-v) -> visually select a column
(shift-i) -> go to insert mode
(your favorite character here - I like #)
esc, esc

Ctrl-A and Ctrl-X [vim.org] find the next number on the line starting at the
cursor, and then increment or decrement it respectively.

1. Tags. No learning curve. Generate tags with !ctags -R *.c *.h (if you are
looking at a C code base). Ctrl-] on any function name, structure name/field,
etc. to jump to the declaration point. Ctrl-T to come back. Tag stack is
maintained. Then, :ta to jump to the tag. Auto completion for the tag name
makes it a breeze. Ctrl-], Ctrl-T, and :ta are enough to save 50% of your
time.

2. Ctrl-P and Ctrl-N for very smart auto-completion can save another 30-50% of
your time.

3.  recording command sequence
qc  record typed character in register c
q   stop recording
@c  execute the contents of c
@@  repeat previous @ command



vip : select upto next blank line


Or right in VIM - :E - would list files in :pwd.

:sh works well when you don't know root, but have sudo privs.


These make it so when a line has wrapped, jk navigation moves one line on the 
screen, instead of one line in the file
nnoremap j gj
nnoremap k gk
vnoremap j gj
vnoremap k gk
nnoremap <Down> gj
nnoremap <Up> gk
vnoremap <Down> gj
vnoremap <Up> gk
inoremap <Down> <C-o>gj
inoremap <Up> <C-o>gk

this gives you a current-row and current-column highlight, so you never lose 
your cursor
set cursorcolumn
set cursorline
hi cursorcolumn ctermbg=red




Ctrl-C instead of Esc for switching from insert mode into command mode
Ctrl-[, which does exactly the same as Escape, and Ctrl-C

To view man page of a word under curser, type K(shift+K)


Deleting empty lines from a file: :%g:^\s*$:d



# --------------------
# Editing binary files
#--------------------
vi -b file.bin

# show hex value of character under cursor in ruler
:set rulerformat=0x%B

# show unprintable chars as hex <xx>
:set display=uhex

# view in hex format
:%!xxd

# revert to normal view (must do before saving)
:!%xxd -r

create it and put your custom syntax file there
    ~/.vim/syntax/mlg.vim
    ~/.vim/syntax/panlog.vim

vim syntax files location
    /usr/share/vim/vim73/syntax

using custom syntax file in vim:
  :set syntax=panlog

common commands in syntax files:
  :syntax keyword <group-name> word1 word2 word3 ...
  :syntax match  <group-name> 'pattern'
  :highlight def link <my-group> <built-in-group>

colorschemes are stored in:
  ~/.vim/colors  OR $VIMRUNTIME/colors

set default colorscheme in .vimrc
  colorscheme aawais




windows (^ means Ctrl )
-------
^Ws: horizontal split
^Wn: horizontal split with new file
^Wv: vertical split
^ww: changes between the panes.
^w+: increase height by 1
^w-: decrease height by 1
^W>: increase width by 1
^W<: decrease width by 1
^w=: makes all panes the same size.
^W_: maximize current window 
^W<direction_key>: to move between windows; direction key relative horizontal or vertical split
^Wx: swap windows
^W_: Maximize height
^W+: restore after ^W_

:on[ly]                 fill screen with current buffer.
:sp [filename]          opens the file in a new horizontal pane.
:vsp [filename]         opens the file in a new vertical pane.
:vsp | b <buffer name>  open named buffer in vertical split
:vert sb 5              open buffer 5 in a vertical split



edit-compile-edit cycle
-----------------------
Using quickfix commands
    cope:           open errors window (means: copen or cw)
    ccl:            close errors window

    <Enter>:        Jump to error
    Ctrl-<Enter>:   Open a new window and jump to error there

    cn             # Next error
    cp             # Previous error
    cl             # See all errors
    cc             # See full error text
    cc [nr]        # Jump to [nr]
    cr             # Jump to first error (rewind)
    clas           # Jump to last error




copy to X11 clipboard
------------------------
"*yy:   copy to X11 clipboard so that it can pasted with middle mouse button
"*p:    paste text form X11 clipboard.

"+yy:   copy to X11 copy/paste clipboard (not needed when compiled with 
        -xterm_clipboard)
"+p:    paste from X11 copy/paste clipboard 

To make clipboard usable through ssh:
ssh -Y aawais@terbium
then use "+y

---------
:set spell spelling=en_us
:set nospell
