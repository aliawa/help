Bare minimum partitions: (root, boot and swap)
------------------------------------------------------------
/       root
/boot
swap    size of this depends on the memory workload of the system and RAM


Recomended partitions:
-----------------------------------------------------------
/        5 GB, Note: "/" is not the same as "/root" 
swap     minimum:256 MB, Recomended:Equal to ram for 2GB-8GB RAM
         Note: there is no "/" before swap
/boot    250 MB, should be ext4
/home    minimum:100 MB 





Create Software RAID
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. create a partition in unallocated space to form part of a software RAID device. 
2. combine two or more RAID partitions into a software RAID device. 
    When you choose this option, you can specify the type of RAID device to create
    (the RAID level). This option is only available when two or more RAID partitions 
    are available on the system.


Raid types:
-----------------------------------------------------------
RAID 0:  Can be used to pool the storage of multiple devices into one large virtual
         device.
RAID 1:  Mirrors the data on one storage device onto one or more other storage devices. 
         requires at least two RAID partitions.
RAID 4:  distributes data across multiple storage devices, but uses one device in the 
         array to store parity info.
RAID 5:  distributes data and parity information across multiple storage devices. 
RAID 6:  instead of storing only one set of parity data, they store two sets. 
         requires at least four RAID partitions
RAID 10: nested RAIDs or hybrid RAIDs.



Create LVM Logical Volume
-----------------------------------------------------------
 1. LVM Physical Volume — create a physical volume in unallocated space.
 2. LVM Volume Group — create a volume group from one or more physical volumes. 
    This option is only available when at least one physical volume is available 
    on the system.
 3. LVM Logical Volume — create a logical volume on a volume group. 
    This option is only available when at least one volume group is available on 
    the system.
