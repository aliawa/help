1. Current state is represented as a pointer to state handler method, which is
   a member of QFsm class

2. When a state handler cannot handle an event it returns its super state


3. State handler returns 0 if it was able to handle the event.


4. Entry, exit, initialization actions are performed by handling Q_ENTRY_SIG,
   Q_EXIT_SIG and Q_INIT_SIG


5. Every state machine derived from QHsm must have "initial" state handler
   that puts the state machine in its inital state.
