StrictRouteFixup:
------------------
if there are route headers in the request then make addr. in
request line as one of the targets


SetTargetConnetion:
---------------------
Set target connection based on info (cid,cid1,cid2) stored in top route
header.


IsTrustedNode:
---------------------
Set RequestContext::mFromTrustedNode to true if
- the request was received on TLS or DTLS and is in the peer is in 
  AclStore::mTlsPeerNameList
- or the source address can be found in AclStore::mAddressList
if the node is trusted it won't be challenged by DigestAuthenticator
monkey.


AmIResponsible
--------------
If the request URI is my uri then I am responsible other wise we will 
relay the request if it is from a client on our domain, in that case 
make the request uri as one of the targets and skip rest of monkeys.



StaticRoute
-----------
Collect all routes that match the request URI based on pattern matching from 
the set of routes entered from WebAdmin and add them to the list of targets.


SimpleStaticRoute
------------------
Replace the routes in the request with the set of routes entered from command
line


LocationServer
--------------
if the request URI is found in our Registeration Database, add the contact to 
the list of targets.





General
----------
Monkeys handle requests and send responses or add targets by calling
context.addTarget() which adds it to ResponseContext.mCandidateTransactionMap
and adds the transaction id to ResponseContext.mTransactionQueueCollection.

which is then processed by baboons such as SimpleTargetHandler.
