class declaration is the same as class definition.

static member:
A variable that is part of a class yet is not part of an object of that class.

static member function:
A function that needs access to members of a class, yet doesn't need to be invoked for a particular object.

copy constructor:
X::X(const X&)

assignment operator:
Table& Table::operator=(const Table& t) {
    if (this != &t) { // beware of self-assignment: t = t
        delet[] p;
        p = new Name[sz=t.sz];
        for (int i=0; i<sz; i++) p[i]=t.p[i];
    }
    return *this;
}

General strategy for assignment operator:
1. protect against self assignment
2. delete old elements
3. initialize
4. copy in new elements (usually every non static member)

How is assignment operator different from copy constructor
A copy constructor initializes uninitialized memory, whereas the copy assignment operator
must xorrectly deal with a well-constructed object.



*this
refers to the object for which a member function is invoked.
Type of this in non-const member funciton is X*
Type of this in const member funciton is const X*


mutable specifier:
A const member function cannot change member variables, but it can change mutable members.
Also mutable members of const objects can be modified. In other words const specifier 
never affects the mutable members.


inline:
member functions defined in class definition is taken to be inline member function.
or explicitly: inline int Date::day() const { return d; }


temporary objects:
A temporary can be assigned to a const reference

void h (string& s1, string& s2) {
    const string& s = s1 + s2; // ok
    string& ss = s1 + s2; // not ok
}


class X {
    X* operator--(); // prefix increment
    X* operator--(int); // postfix increment
    X operator-(X); // binary minus
}


General rule for make operators members or non-members:
Make member: operators that inherently modify the value of their first argument, example +=
Make non-member: operators that simply produce a new value based on argumnets, example +

class complex {
    double re, im;
public:
    complex& operator+=(complex a);
}

complex operator+(complex a, complex b) {
    complex r=a;
    return r +=b; // access representation through +=
}



Conversion operator:
X::operator T(); // the return type is T and should not be specified.


friend:
If a friend takes an argument of class then it can be declared in the declaration
of the class.

class X {
    X(int);
    int m1();

    friend int f1(X&);
};

Essential Operators:
class X {
    X(Sometype); // constructor
    X(const X&); // copy constructor
    X& operator= (const X&); // assignment operator
    ~X(); // Destructor
};



Value semantics: After s1=s2, s1 and s2 are fully distinc and changes to one does 
not affect the other.
Poiter semantics: After s1=s2, changes to s2 affect s1.


Derived class refers to its base

Employee
  ^
  |
  |
Manager


slicing:
Employee e = m; // construct e from Employee part of m

polymorphic behavior in C++:
only when virtual member function is called and the object is 
manipulated through pointer or reference

polymorphic class:
A class that declares or inherits at least one virtual function 
is called a polymorphic class.


Abstract class:
A class with one or more pure virtual functions.


operator<<
----------
ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const string&);

Funcion Object
-------------
An object of class with an application operator "operator()"

Predicate
-----------
A function object or function that returns a bool
