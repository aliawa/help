LANs are independent networks that are physically separated from each
other. Different LANs can be connected to each other through routers.

VLANs on the other hand can create distint networks on the same physical 
hardware.

At Network Layer (OSI Layer 3), subnets create separater network 
subnets so that broadcasts in one segment stay within the same subnet. In 
a similar fashion, VLANs create network segments at Data Link Layer
(OSI Layer 2) where broadcasts within on segment remain in the same segment.



VLANs are identified by inserting a 32 bit (4 bytes) field between the 
source MAC address and EtherType/Length fields of the original 
ethernet frame.
The first 16 bits of the 32 bit field are always 0x8100. This value
indicates that it is a 802.1Q tagged frame. Untagged frames have the 
EtherType/Length field at the exact same position. 

Normal:
[Dest 6 bytes] [Src 6 bytes] [Ether Type 2 bytes] [Payload 46-1500 bytes] [CRC]

Taged:
[Dest 6 bytes] [Src 6 bytes] [802.1Q 4 bytes] [Ether Type 2 bytes] [Payload 42-1500 bytes] [CRC]
