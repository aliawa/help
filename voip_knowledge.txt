Delay
-------------------------------------------
Standard Delay Limits
ITU G.114
0   - 150 ms  Acceptable in most cases
150 - 400 ms  Can be acceptable
Above 400 ms  Unacceptable.

If delay reises above 250ms, talkers and listners become unsynchronized
resulting in "talker overlap". Which the users finding anying even
though the overall voice quality may be acceptable.

Echo cancellers are required when one way delay exceeds 25ms.



Voice Quality
-------------------------------------------
What factors affect voice quiality.
compression algorithm (codec) used (G.711, G.723 etc.)
Packet loss
Echo cancellation.
Fixed Delay (processing. packetization etc.)
Variable Delay (Jitter), due to queuing, congestion, path through network.
