The core NAT problem:
----------------------
The NAT simplicity works well when the
applications are limited to a client/server model with the server
deployed on the public side of the NAT.  For peer-to-peer, multi-
party, or servers deployed on the private side of the NAT, helper
technologies must also be deployed.  These helper technologies are
frequently complex to develop and manage, creating a hidden cost to
this 'simple gateway'.


NATv6

translation function of the network prefix translator

The default NPTv6 address-mapping mechanism is purely algorithmic

These applications currently require
Application Layer Gateways (ALGs) to work correctly through NAPT44
devices, and similar ALGs may be required for these applications to
work through NPTv6 Translators


A router that implements an NPTv6 prefix translation
function is referred to as an NPTv6 Translator.
