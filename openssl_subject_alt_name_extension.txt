# Specify the section of config file that contains extensions
openssl x509 -extensions <section>


Subject Alternative Name.

The subject alternative name extension allows various literal values 
to be included in the configuration file. These include email 
(an email address) URI a uniform resource indicator, 
DNS (a DNS domain name), RID (a registered ID: OBJECT IDENTIFIER), 
    IP (an IP address), dirName (a distinguished name) and otherName.

The email option include a special 'copy' value. This will automatically
include and email addresses contained in the certificate subject name in the
extension.

The IP address used in the IP options can be in either IPv4 or IPv6 
format.

The value of dirName should point to a section containing the distinguished
name to use as a set of name value pairs. Multi values AVAs can be formed by
preceeding the name with a + character.

otherName can include arbitrary data associated with an OID: the value should
be the OID followed by a semicolon and the content in standard
ASN1_generate_nconf(3) format.

Examples:

subjectAltName=email:copy,email:my@other.address,URI:http://my.url.here/
subjectAltName=IP:192.168.7.1
subjectAltName=IP:13::17
subjectAltName=email:my@other.address,RID:1.2.3.4
subjectAltName=otherName:1.2.3.4;UTF8:some other identifier
