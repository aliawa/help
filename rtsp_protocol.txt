How does client find about the media stream 
------------------------------------------------------------
RTSP URL identifies the media stream
Client learns about the properties of media by downloading a "presentation
description" file. Client obtains this file using any means such as http etc
from somewhere, for example a Web page


RTSP actually controls presentation
------------------------------------
Presentations have names that is included in the URL, forexample "twister". Presentation is a
combination of streams such as audio and video.
rtsp://media.example.com:554/twister


How does the client find out the server port and address
---------------------------------------------------------
From the RTSP URL:
rtsp://<host>:<port>         use tcp
rtsp://<host>/<path>         use tcp port 554
rtspu://<host>:<port>        use udp



Use of SDP.
------------
* SDP can be retrieved by clients from server using HTTP or DESCRIBE. So SDP is
  only send from server to client.
* The port in "m=" is typically 0, if it does contain a value it is just a
  recomendation from server, the client can ignore it.
* The "c=" field is typically "0.0.0.0" because the destination address is
  specified by client in SETUP request.
* Aggregate Control: if there is session level "a=control" field then it is to control all
  streams. Media level "a=control" is for individual streams.


Default server port
------------------
554


RTSP has sessions
-----------------
during its lifetime, a single media stream may be controlled by RTSP requests issued 
sequentially on different TCP connections. Therefore, the server needs to maintain 
"session state" to be able to correlate RTSP requests within a stream


RTSP message length
-------------------------
- An empty line containing only CRLF
- Content-Length header if present



mode=record / mode=play
-------------------------
- In record mode the stream source address is the client unless another address
  is given in source= field.
- In play mode the stream source in server unless source= field contains a
  different address.


destination in SETUP
-------------------------
If the presentation is to be sent only to the client via unicast, the client
provides the destination for security reasons.

The client may specify the multicast address with the destination parameter
NOTE: client can only specify multicast address in "destination="

Unless the media content has a fixed destination address, the "c=" field is to be set 
to a suitable null value. For addresses of type "IP4", this value is "0.0.0.0"
NOTE: In most cases the "c=" will be null, because the destination address is 
exchanged in SETUP


client_port
-----------
This parameter provides the unicast RTP/RTCP port pair on which the client has chosen to 
receive media data and control information
NOTE: only makes sense for unicast



Media transport
----------------
The media always flows from server to client therefore only one address is
needed. There are three cases.
    unicast: transmitted to the source of RTSP request with port chosen by client
    multicast: server chooses address: e.g. live transmission.
    multicast: client chooses address: e.g. server to participate in existing multicast conference


Methods:
----------
SETUP:      Start an RTP session
PLAY:       Start data stream on a session allocated via SETUP
PAUSE:      Temporarily halts a stream without freeing server resources
TEARDOWN:   Frees resource associated with the stream.
DESCRIBE:   Obtain media information about the resource identified by request
            URL. The response contains SDP



Asterisk in request URI
------------------------------
The asterisk "*" in the Request-URI means that the request does not
apply to a particular resource, but to the server itself, and is only
allowed when the method used does not necessarily apply to a
resource.  Example: OPTIONS * RTSP/1.0


Interleaved media
--------------------
Media can be sent on the RTSP control channel
Transport: RTP/AVP/TCP;interleaved=0-1
means channel 0 and 1 are interleaved


More than one Request in the same connection
----------------------------------------------------------------------
9.1 Pipelining
   A client that supports persistent connections or connectionless mode
   MAY "pipeline" its requests (i.e., send multiple requests without
   waiting for each response). A server MUST send its responses to those
   requests in the same order that the requests were received.12.37 Session


Session identifier
----------------------------------------------------------------------
From 12.37 Session
   The session identifier is needed to distinguish several delivery
   requests for the same URL coming from the same client.
