A Minimal SIP message
---------------------------
SIP/2.0 100 OK
Via:SIP/2.0/TCP 1.1.1.1;branch=z
From:sip:1@1.1.1.1;tag=a
To:sip:2@2.2.2.2
CSeq:0 INVITE
Call-ID:5
Contact:sip:2@1.1.1.1
Content-Length:0

SIP purpose:
--------------
establish, modify, terminate  multimedia sessions/telephony calls


SIP Message Basic Format
------------------------
Start Line
header
.
.

Empty Line
Message Body    <<< note: does not include the CRLF separating header fields
                    and body (RFC 3261, 20.14)



What restrictions does offer/answer model lay on where offer and answer
can appear in SIP messages.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The initial offer must be in INVITE
   if not there then in the first non-failure message from UAS back to UAC.

2. If the initial offer is in INVITE the answer must be in a reliable
   non-failure message from UAS. If 1xx also has an answer it is just
   a copy.
   
   offer        answer
   --------     -------
   INVITE       reliable 1xx
                200 OK

3. If the offer is in the first reilable non-failure message from UAS, the 
   answer must be int the acknowledgement to that message.

   offer            answer
   --------         -------
   reliable 1xx     PRACK
   200 OK           ACK
   

4. UAC can have only one unanswered offer at a given time

5. UAC cannot send a new offer in the same INVITE transaction.


Is it possible for a 1xx reponse to have an offer?
yes if it is a reliable provisional response
----------------------------------------------------
If the answer to the above is yes. Which message will contain
the answer?
PRACK


When will UAC create an early dialog?
----------------------------------------------------
When a provisional response contains a To tag, and the
dialog-id (call-id, from-tag, to-tag) does not match any existing dialogs



CSeq:
-----------------------------------------------------
The CSeq header field serves to order transactions within a dialog, 
to provide a means to uniquely identify transactions, and to differentiate 
between new requests and request retransmissions.

For non-REGISTER requests outside of a dialog, the sequence number value
is arbitrary.

The CSeq number is incremented for each new request within a dialog.

For new requeststs in response to 401,413,415,416,420, CSeq should contain 
a new sequence number that is one higher than the previous.

The Request-URI , Call-ID, To, the numeric part of CSeq, and From header 
fields in the CANCEL request MUST be identical to those in the request 
being cancelled, including tags.

The CSeq header field in the ACK MUST contain the same value for the
sequence number as was present in the original request, but
the method parameter MUST be equal to “ACK”.

CSeq value guarantees proper ordering of REGISTER requests. A UA must
increment the CSeq value by one for each REGISTER request with the same 
Call-ID.





Can a REFER be sent outside a dialog:
-----------------------------------------------------
Yes when the Transferee supports the Target-Dialog extension, and the 
transferor knows the Contact URI is routable outside the dialog.




What is a target refresh request?
----------------------------------------------------------------
A target refresh request modifies the remote target URI of the dialog.
Meaning the contact header in the request will be copied to the 
remote-target-uri of the dialog.

Also 2xx responses to target-refresh-requests update the remote target.

re-INVITE, UPDATE, SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY are target refresh requests
ACK and INFO are non-target-refresh requests.




How can a route set of a dialog be changed once the dialog
has been established?
----------------------------------------------------------------
There is no way to that. Even target refresh requests cannot
update the route set. Doing so will introduce backwards 
compatibility problems with RFC 2543



How is attended transfer using REFER different from Blind transfer?
----------------------------------------------------------------
The refer for the attended transfer will have a Replaces header 
inside the Refer-To header. The header will be copied by the 
receipient of refer to the triggered INVITE. 

The final recepient will then replace its existing dialog identified
by the replaces header with the new dialog created by the invite
request.




Requirements of a reliable provisional response:
------------------------------------------------
It MUST contain a Require header field containing the
option tag 100rel, and MUST include an RSeq header field.
(taken from: RFC 3262)



Register scenarios
------------------
Cancel a registration:           Send register with Expires: 0
Get contact list from Registrar: Send register with no contact header.


Registrar information
-----------------------------------------------------
A registrar data base entry will look like this:
Address-of-Record: <Contact-URI>, <Call-ID>, <CSeq>

Each binding record records the Call-ID and CSeq values from the request.



non-unique branch parameters in new requests
-----------------------------------------------------
CANCEL: same branch ID as the request being canceled
ACK for a non-2xx: same branch ID as the INVITE.


Content-Length
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The size of the message-body does not include the CRLF separating
header fields and body.
