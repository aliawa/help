Since H.323 is designed to work on any LAN protocol, therefore it calls port, by 
a generic name TSAP, because port is specific to UDP/TCP


Fast Connect:
The endpoint prepares several variants of the h.245 request openLogicalChannel, based
on how many codecs it supports.

After that, the endpoint encodes each variant of the message to the binary form
and the resulting array of binary strings is inserted into a H.225.0/Q.931 
message (usually the Setup message)

The called party will pick one of the variants and confirm it back in the next 
H.225.0/Q.931 message, together with its own list of logical channel variants.

H.245 tunneling
To avoid the need to open a second TCP/IP channel for H.245, H.323 version 2
and above support the tunneling of H.245 messages. The H.245 message is encoded
to the binary form (using ASN.1 PER) and the resulting string of bytes is
inserted to any Q.931/H.225.0 message that is currently being sent. If there is
no available message, the endpoint uses the Facility message instead. 





RAS Messages:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gatekeeper discovery:
  GRQ (Gatekeeper_Request)   always sent to multicast group 224.0.1.41 port 1718
  GCF (Gatekeeper_Confirmation) 
  GRJ (Gatekeeper_Reject)

Endpoint Registraion
  RRQ (Registration_Request)Sent from an endpoint to a gatekeeper RAS channel address.
  RCF (Registration_Confirm)A reply from the gatekeeper that confirms endpoint registration.
  RRJ (Registration_Reject) A reply from the gatekeeper that rejects endpoint registration.
  URQ (Unregister_Request) 	Sent from endpoint or gatekeeper to cancel registration.
  UCF (Unregister_Confirm) 	Sent from endpoint or gatekeeper to confirm an unregistration.
  URJ (Unregister_Reject) 	Indicates that the endpoint was not preregistered with the gatekeeper.
 
Admission:
  ARQ (Admission_Request) 	An attempt by an endpoint to initiate a call.
  ACF (Admission_Confirm) 	An authorization by the gatekeeper to admit the call. 
                            This message contains the IP address of the terminating gateway or gatekeeper and 
                            enables the original gateway to initiate call control signaling procedures.
  ARJ (Admission_Reject) 	Denies the request of the endpoint to gain access to the network for this 
                            particular call.

Endpoint Location:
  LRQ (Location_Request)    Sent to request the gatekeeper contact information for one or more E.164 addresses.
  LCF (Location_Confirm)    Sent by the gatekeeper and contains the call signaling channel or RAS channel 
                            address of itself or the requested endpoint. LCF uses its own address when GKRCS is 
                            used. LCF uses the requested endpoint address when Directed Endpoint Call 
                            Signaling is used.
  LRJ (Location_Reject) 	Sent by gatekeepers that received an LRQ for which the requested endpoint is not 
                            registered or has unavailable resources.

Information Request:
  IRQ (Information_Request) A status request sent from gatekeeper to endpoint.
  IRR (Information_Request_Response)  
                            Sent from endpoint to gatekeeper in response to IRQ. This message is 
                            also sent from endpoint to gatekeeper if the gatekeeper requests 
                            periodic status updates. The IRR is used by gateways to inform the 
                            gatekeeper about the active calls.
  IACK (Info_Request_Acknowledge) 	  
                            Used by the gatekeeper in order to respond to IRR messages.
  INACK (Info_Request_Neg_Acknowledge)
                            Used by the gatekeeper in order to respond to IRR messages.




H.323 call setup
------------------------------------------
Step 0: RAS Signalling
Endpoint discovers GK by multicasting GRQ, gets GRJ or GCF from GK containg Transport Address of GK RAS channel
Enpoint registers with GK, to inform GK of its alias address and Transport address

Step 1:  RAS Signalling
This step is skipped if there is no Gatekeeper
Terminal sends RAS messages to the address and the well known TSAP identifier (aka port) of GK RAS channel
Possibly send LRQ to GK to translate destination alias to Transport address
Send ARQ Admission request message to GK, UDP destination port: 1719
Receive ACF from GK with Call Signalling Transport address of GK or other EP


Step 2: 
exchange of call signalling messages on a Call Signalling channel
Call signalling messages on H.225 channel (TCP/Dynamic port or 1720)
Receive Connect message containing H.245 control channel address, H.245 address can also come
in Alerting, Call Proceeding and Setup messages

Step 3:
Establish H.245 Control Channel (TCP/Dynamic port)

Step 4:
RTP/RTCP


    

H.225 RAS: (Registration/Admission/Status) (on wireshark RAS:..)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
UDP, ports(or TSAP identifier):[unicast 1719, multicast 1718]
RAS is the signaling protocol used between gateways(endpoints) and gatekeepers.
- gatekeeper discovery
- endpoint registration
Important fields:
    callReferenceValue: which call does this message belong to
    conferenceID: 
    callIdentifier: Associate RAS and Q.931 for a call
    
    LCF
    callSignalAddress: The transport address to which to send H.225.0 call signalling; 
    uses the reliable well known or dynamic port, 
    but may be an endpoint or gatekeeper address depending on the call model in use.

    rasAddress – Registration, admissions, and status address for the located endpoint.


H.225 (modified Q.931 signalling) (on wireshark CS:..)
------------------------------------------------------

TCP, Endpoint to Endpoint port 1720, GK dynamic port
Important fields:
    h245Address – This is a specific transport address on which the called endpoint or 
    gatekeeper handling the call would like to establish H.245 signalling. 
    This address may also be sent in Call Proceeding, Progress, Connect, or Facility.

    fastStart – Used only in the fast connect procedure, fastStart supports
    the signalling needed to open a logical channel. This uses the
    OpenLogicalChannel structure defined in ITU-T Rec. H.245, but the sender
    of this indicates the modes it prefers to receive and transmit, and the
    transport addresses where it expects to receive media streams.
    callReferenceValue: which call does this message belong to

    destCallSignalAddress – Needed to inform the gatekeeper of the destination
    terminal's call signalling transport address; redundant in the direct
    terminal-to-terminal case. In all cases where the information is available to
    the sender of the Setup message, this field shall be filled in.


H.245
------------------------------------------
TCP, Dynamic port
Used to start and stop video, audio, and data protocol.

Step 1: Determine master slave
SessionID: 1=audio 2=video 3=data

• MasterSlaveDetermination (MSD). used to prevent conflicts between two terminals.

• TerminalCapabilitySet (TCS). Message capabilities supported by the terminals that take part in a call

• OpenLogicalChannel (OLC). Message to open the logical channel 

• CloseLogicalChannel (CLC). Message to close the information logical channel.

How both sides get each others mediaChannel ip/port. Four messages are required

   Master                   Slave
   ----------- OLC ---------->
   forwardLogicalChannelNumber:2
   dataType: videoData
   dynamicRTPpayloadType: 97
   mediaControlChannel: ip/port

   <---------- OLC Ack -------             
   forwardLogicalChannelNumber:2
   mediaChannel: ip/port
   mediaControlChannel: ip/port

   <---------- OLC -----------
   forwardLogicalChannelNumber:3
   dataType: videoData
   dynamicRTPpayloadType: 97
   mediaControlChannel: ip/port

   ----------- OLC Ack -------->             
   forwardLogicalChannelNumber:3
   mediaChannel: ip/port
   mediaControlChannel: ip/port


              
H.225 Fields
------------------------------------------
Call Reference Value (CRV):
Associate call signalling or RAS messages between 2 entities within the same call
A value of zero is global-call-reference-value, meaning message is not related to a call
Associate message with a call

Call-Id
Associate all messages between all entities within the same call

Conference Id (CID):
Associate all messages between all entities within all calls in the same conference



Wireshark
------------
Filter all "OpenLogicalChannels":  h225.facility_element
in description h225 ras is shown as RAS: gatekeeperRequest
h225 call signalling is shown as CS: facility OpenLogicalChannel


H225 Messages
------------
Uses aligned PER encoding
There shall be no fragmentaion of H.245 messages across transport PDUs, this PDU is defined by TPKT

sessionID:
    1   primary audio
    2   primary video
    3   data

mediaControlChannel RTCP

forwardLogicalChannelParameters     sender's source address
reverseLogicalChannelParameters     sender's destination address


Call Signalling     section 7 in H.323

There are three types of channels
    1 RAS channel, UDP destination port 1719 
    2 Call signalling channel, TCP destination port 1720
    3 Logical channels, dynamic port

Endpoint has
    Call Signalling Channel Address


There are three ways to exchange h.245
    1   Fast connect
    2   H.245 encapsulation
    3   H.245 connection
