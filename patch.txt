"patch applied with 'fuzz'."
patch had to modify the patch a bit to make it fit


"Hunk #2 succeeded at 1887 with fuzz 2 (offset 7 lines)."
patch had to adjust the location of the change


"Hunk #3 FAILED at 2387."
check .rej file with the change that caused patch to fail
and .orig file with original content


"Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n]"
if you have already applied the patch say "n" and abort
if you forgot to specify "-R" say "y" to revert
could also happen that creator of patch reversed the source and 
destination directories. in this case "y" will in fact apply the patch


"patch: **** unexpected end of file in patch"
Can sometimes be fixed by joining the two lines that had been split
