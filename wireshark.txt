Lua can be used to write dissectors, post-dissectors and taps.

Post-dissectors:: are dissectors meant to run after every other dissector has run. 
They can add items the dissection tree so they can be used to create your own extensions 
to the filtering mechanism.

Taps:: are used to collect information after the packet has been dissected.

To disable Lua scripts, set the enable_lua variable to false in init.lua
init.lua is loaded before any other lua scripts
