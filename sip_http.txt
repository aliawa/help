RFC 822: Syntax of text messages that are sent among computers

RFC 822 defines the general header field format
field-name ":" [field-body] CRLF


RFC 2822 says that header fields are lines composed of a
field name followed by a colon, followed by a field body and
terminated by a CRLF.

According to RFC 2822 the address header should be generally in
this form:

[display-name] <address>

From and To headers are also defined in RFC 2822

Both HTTP and SIP messages have the same basic format

possibly a message body.
