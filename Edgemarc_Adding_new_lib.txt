e30/build directory
--------------------

1. e30/build/generic_cp_mods
   Add logic to:
   - untar the library tar file in snapgear/lib/libxyz
   - run configure with --host option for example:
     CFLAGS=$CROSS_FLAGS ./configure --host=$CROSS_HOST --disable-shared
   - copy the changed files from the e30/sna3.1.0/lib/libxyz directory
     to snapgear/lib/libxyz. This step may not be needed in generic_cp_
     mods.


e30/snapgear-3.X.X directory
----------------------------
1. Add the line to e30/snapgear-3.1.0/lib/Makefile
   dir_$(CONFIG_LIB_LIBXYZ) += srtp
   This will add the srtp directory to the list of directories that
   need to be built. This file will copied to snapgear/lib/Makefile


2. Add the line to  $PTOP_OS/vendors/Edgewater/$ENTARGET/config.vendor
   CONFIG_LIB_LIBXYZ=y
   This is needed so that the definitions are available in generic_cp_
   mods script.  This file will be copied to snapgear/config/.config, but
   make sure that you do step 6 otherwise the line will be removed from
   .config by "make dep" or "make config", I am not sure exactly how this
   happens.


3. Create a directory for the new library  under e30/snapgear-3.1.0/lib/.
   e.g, libxyz
   Copy the library Makefile into the new directory and add the following
   line to it 
   romfs:
        $(ROMFSINST)    /lib/libxyz.a
   This file will replace snapgear/lib/libxyz/Makefile, as extracted from
   the tar file.
   The romfs line will cause libxyz.a to be copied to /lib on the target 
   system. The format is 
	            $(ROMFSINST) <filename> <destination>
   if the <filename> is omitted it is assumed to be the base name of
   <destination>



4. Make sure that the CC and CXX variables are defined as follows in 
   the library Makefile
				CC      = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc
				CXX     = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc


5. Enter help text in e30/snapgear-3.1.0/config/Configure.help.
   This file will be copied to  snapgear/config/Configure.help


6. Add the line to e30/snapgear-3.1.0/config/config.in
   bool 'LIBXYZ'                       CONFIG_LIB_LIBXYZ
   This file will be copied to snapgear/config/config.in





Using the libray in MAND
-------------------------
1. modify mand Makefile to link to the new library and set the include paths:
   ifdef CONFIG_LIB_LIBXYZ
     LIBLIBXYZ_LDPATH = -L$(ROOTDIR)/lib/srtp
     LDPATH   += $(LIBLIBXYZ_LDPATH)
     LDFLAGS  += $(LIBLIBXYZ_LDPATH)

     USER_INCLUDES         += -I$(ROOTDIR)/lib/srtp/include
     USER_INCLUDES         += -I$(ROOTDIR)/lib/srtp/crypto/include	
     USER_POST_LIBS        += -lsrtp
   endif
   
   ROOTDIR is the same as $OSTOP defined in $PTOP/build/sg_top.defs




Adding a user Application
-------------------------
1. If an executable needs to go in /usr/bin directory it needs to be installed
from the $OSTOP/user/<executable-name>/Makefile because the /usr/bin directory
does not exist when the $OSTOP/lib/<...>/Makefile is exectued
