Comments about pasting deleted text

Alt-y  will cycle through all entries in the kill ring and will paste each entry successively.


How did I configure emacs to act properly on [del] and [backspace]
------------------------------------------------------------------
put in .emacs file:
from The Linux keyboard and console HOWTO

(global-unset-key [backspace] )
(global-set-key [backspace] 'delete-backward-char)
(global-unset-key [delete] )
(global-set-key [delete] 'delete-char)


Problems for a user coming from windows world
----------------------------------------------
1. [del] and [backspace] both act as backspace
2. if a region is selected [del] will not delete the region as expected
3. cursor movement with arrow keys is very slow.
4. Ctrl-x is Ctrl-w
5. Ctrl-z is Alt-Shift and -
6. Ctrl-v is Ctrl-y
7. Ctrl-y is same as undo
